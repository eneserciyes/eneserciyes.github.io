## Hello, I'm Enes

<br />

I am Enes Erciyes, a master's student at NYU Courant. I previously worked on autonomous driving.
I founded the Koc University AI and Robotics Society and led a team of 20 people to build a [self-driving vehicle](https://youtu.be/BU6hqeaTKyg) from scratch (with a very small budget).
I also spent some time at [Wayve](https://wayve.ai/)

I am currently working on robot learning and novel 3D scene representations with [Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/) at NYU.
