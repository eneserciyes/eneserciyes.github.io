## Hello, I'm Enes

<br />

I am Enes Erciyes, a master's student at NYU Courant. I previously worked on autonomous driving.
I founded the Koc University AI and Robotics Society and led a team of 20 people to build a [self-driving vehicle](https://youtu.be/BU6hqeaTKyg) from scratch.
I also spent some time at [Wayve](https://wayve.ai/) working on [scaling AV simulation](https://wayve.ai/thinking/introducing-wayve-infinity-simulator/) and building a [neural simulator](https://wayve.ai/thinking/ghost-gym-neural-simulator/).

I am currently working on robot learning and novel 3D scene representations with [Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/) at NYU.
